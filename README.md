# Github to SmallHost
⚠️ **You need WinSCP installed for this to work!** You can [install WinSCP here](https://winscp.net/download/WinSCP-5.19.4-Setup.exe) (11.3 MB). To ensure Github to SmallHost works, at WinSCP installation install it to all users (not just you). Without WinSCP, Github to SmallHost cannot connect to SmallHost's FTP server to upload the repo.
